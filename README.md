Hi, Iâ€™m <b>Ida!</b> ðŸ’— Iâ€™m studying <b>Graphic Information Technology</b> with a focus on <b>User Experience Design</b> at ASU. Though Iâ€™m now on the east coast, Iâ€™m originally from the west coast and have a love for the great outdoors.

Outside of my studies, I enjoy hiking, camping, and exploring design. Iâ€™ve won UX Hackathons online and continually grow my skills in drawing, coding, and human-centered design. For me, design is both a career and a passion, driving me to create impactful experiences.

<b>Skills:</b> JS â™¡ HTML â™¡ CSS

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on this page.
