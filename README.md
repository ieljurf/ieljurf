Hi, Iâ€™m Ida! Iâ€™m studying Graphic Information Technology with a focus on User Experience Design at ASU. Though Iâ€™m now on the east coast, Iâ€™m originally from the west coast and have a love for the great outdoors.

Outside of my studies, I enjoy hiking, camping, and exploring design. Iâ€™ve won UX Hackathons online and continually grow my skills in drawing, coding, and human-centered design. For me, design is both a career and a passion, driving me to create impactful experiences.

Skills: JS â™¡ HTML â™¡ CSS

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on this page.
